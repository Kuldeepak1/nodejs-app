Problem faced during this assignment:
(node:1) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [mongodb:27017] on first connect [Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mongodb
    at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (dns.js:71:26) {
  name: 'MongoNetworkError'

 caused pods to face Crashloopback error.

 I tried to solve this error by introducing mongo service but still facing it.
 I was not able to solve this.
